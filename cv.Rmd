### About Me

I am a PhD Candidate in the Kinesiology department at UMass Amherst with a research emphasis in single molecule biophysics and molecular muscle physiology. Specifically, I am interested in understanding how myosin transduces chemical energy into the mechanical forces that drive human motion with additional interest in the regulation of this process via the proteins troponin and tropomyosin. The primary experimental techniques I use are the laser trap and in vitro motility assays.

### About Me

I am a post-doctoral research associate in the Biochemistry & Molecular Biophysics department at Washington University in St. Louis in the [Greenberg Lab](https://glab.biochem.wustl.edu/). More specifically, I am interested in understanding the basic functions of the heart from a molecular perspective in efforts to better understand the manifestations of various heart diseases such as genetic cardiomyopathies and congenital atrial septal defect.
